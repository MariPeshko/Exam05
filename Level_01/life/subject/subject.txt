Life:

Submitted files: *.c, *.h
Allowed functions: atoi, read, putchar, malloc, calloc, realloc, free

Write a program that simulates the game of life.

Prototype of program: ./life width height iterations

Width and height are the dimensions of the board and iterations is the 
number of iterations of the game of life.

The initial configuration of the board will be drawn by a sequence 
of commands in the standard input.

Imagine a pen starting in the top left corner of the board.
Each command is one of these characters:
	'w', 'a', 's', 'd': move the pen up, left, down, and right.
	'x': 		lift or lower the pen in order to start or stop drawing.
   Default is: pen not drawing.

Once end of the tile is reached, your program must simulate a game of life on
board and print the result in stdout (each cell alive will be represented by
the character 'O' and each dead cell will be represented by a space).

Each cell outside of the array will be considered dead.

Examples:

$> echo 'sdxddssaaww' | ./a.out 5 5 O | cat -e
     $
 OOO $
 O O $
 OOO $
     $

$> echo 'sdxssdswdxdddxsaddawxwdxwaa' | ./a.out 1O 6 O | cat -e
          $
 O   OOO  $
 O     O  $
 OOO  O   $
  O  OOO  $
          $

$> echo 'dxss' | ./a.out 3 3 O | cat -e
 O $
 O $
 O $

$> echo 'dxss' | ./a.out 3 3 1 | cat -e
   $
OOO$
   $

$> echo 'dxss' | ./a.out 3 3 2 | cat -e
 O $
 O $
 O $
